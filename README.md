# Completely Unscientific Benchmarks

> [There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies,_damned_lies,_and_statistics)

For this benchmark we implemented [Treap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treap)
in a few classic (C++, Java, Python) and hyped (JavaScript, Kotlin, Swift, Rust)
programming languages and tested their performance on Linux, Mac OS, and
Windows (all of them running on different hardware, so the results should not
be compared between platforms).

This turned out to be a good benchmark of memory-intensive operations, which
should have been pushed memory management implementations to their edge.

First, we tried to play by the rules of the garbage-collected languages, thus
there are "ref-counted" versions of implementations for C++ and Rust, but then
we still wanted to compare the results with idiomatic (a.k.a. common practices)
implementations for C++ ("raw-pointers") and Rust ("idiomatic").

I must say that all the implementations except for C++ were implemented by
mostly adapting the syntax from the very first implementation of the algorithm
in Kotlin. Even Rust, which is considered to have the steepest learning curve
among the tested languages, didn't require any "black magic" (the solution does
not require either unsafe code or lifetime annotations). C++ was implemented
separately, so it has a few shortcuts, and thus it might be not a completely
fair comparison (I will try to implement "fair" C++ solution and also
"C++"-like Rust solution to see if the performance can be on par).

## Measurements

To measure time we used `time` util on Mac OS and Windows (msys2 environment),
and [`cgmemtime`](https://github.com/gsauthof/cgmemtime) on Linux.

Memory measurement was only available on Linux with `cgmemtime` util, which
leverages CGroup capabilities to capture the high-water RSS+CACHE memory usage.

## Observations

C++ "ref-counted" (`shared ptr`) has significant performance hit on non-Linux
platforms.

JVM speeds up if you limit its memory.

JVM uses some tricks (JIT) which helps it to cut down some reference counting
overheads and it manages to go faster than C++ and Rust "ref-counted"
solutions.

Kotlin Native is still much slower than the Kotlin running in JVM.

Kotlin JS produces JS code which is ~25% slower than the manual Kotlin to JS
translation.

With CPython vs PyPy you trade speed for memory.
