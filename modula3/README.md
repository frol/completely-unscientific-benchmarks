# Modula-2

## Compile

To compile with the Critical Mass Modula-3 compiler,
first change to the version you wish to compile.
Once you're in that directory, type

```
cm3 -O3
```

## Execute

You will have to look to see where the compiler placed your executable.
(On my macOS notebook, it's placed in a folder named `AMD64_DARWIN`.)
Run the generated executable.
