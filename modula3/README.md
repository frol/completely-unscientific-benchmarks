# Modula-3

Author: John Perry (john.perry@usm.edu)

## Compile

To compile with the [Critical Mass Modula-3 compiler](https://github.com/modula3/cm3/releases),
first change to the version you wish to compile.
Once you're in that directory, type

```
cm3 -O
```

## Execute

You will have to look to see where the compiler placed your executable.
(On my macOS notebook, it's placed in a folder named `AMD64_DARWIN`.)
Run the generated executable.
