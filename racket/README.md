# Racket

Author: Gustavo Massaccesi (@gus-massa)

This is based in the Clojure program, but it uses mutable
structs instead of immutable objects.

## Execute

You don't need to compile the program, just run it:

```
racket main.rkt
```

Or you can compile it to bytecode first, to expand it
and save a small amount of time when it runs:

```
raco main.rkt
racket main.rkt
```
